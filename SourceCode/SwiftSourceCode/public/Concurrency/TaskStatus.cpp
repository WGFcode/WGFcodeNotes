/// For the most part, the active task status records of a task are

/// no synchronization would be required to change them.  However,
/// cancellation and escalation can occur asynchronously, and they
/// must be able to inspect the status records without worrying about
/// their concurrent modification or destruction of the records.
/// Therefore, these operations freeze the active status records
/// for their duration.  They do this by (1) setting a bit in the
/// task's `Status` field state which says that the records are
/// locked and (2) creating a lock record as the new innermost
/// status record.  When the operation is complete, it removes this
/// record and clears the lock bit, then notifies the lock record that
/// the locking operation is complete.
///
/// When a task wants to change its active status record, but
/// it sees that the locked bit is set in the `Status` field, it
/// must acquire the global status-record lock, find this record
/// (which should be the innermost record), and wait for an unlock.
