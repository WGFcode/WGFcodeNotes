/// Routines related to the global concurrent execution service.
///
/// The execution side of Swift's concurrency model centers around
/// scheduling work onto various execution services ("executors").
/// Executors vary in several different dimensions:
///
/// First, executors may be exclusive or concurrent.  An exclusive
/// executor can only execute one job at once; a concurrent executor
/// can execute many.  Exclusive executors are usually used to achieve
/// some higher-level requirement, like exclusive access to some
/// resource or memory.  Concurrent executors are usually used to
/// manage a pool of threads and prevent the number of allocated
/// threads from growing without limit.
/// 
/// Second, executors may own dedicated threads, or they may schedule
/// work onto some some underlying executor.  Dedicated threads can
/// improve the responsiveness of a subsystem *locally*, but they impose
/// substantial costs which can drive down performance *globally*
/// if not used carefully.  When an executor relies on running work
/// on its own dedicated threads, jobs that need to run briefly on
/// that executor may need to suspend and restart.  Dedicating threads
/// to an executor is a decision that should be made carefully
/// and holistically.
///
/// If most executors should not have dedicated threads, they must
/// be backed by some underlying executor, typically a concurrent
/// executor.  The purpose of most concurrent executors is to
/// manage threads and prevent excessive growth in the number
/// of threads.  Having multiple independent concurrent executors
/// with their own dedicated threads would undermine that.
/// Therefore, it is sensible to have a single, global executor
/// that will ultimately schedule most of the work in the system.  
/// With that as a baseline, special needs can be recognized and
/// carved out from the global executor with its cooperation.
///
/// This file defines Swift's interface to that global executor.
///
/// The default implementation is backed by libdispatch, but there
/// may be good reasons to provide alternatives (e.g. when building
/// a single-threaded runtime).

  // We really want four things from the global execution service:
  //  - Enqueuing work should have minimal runtime and memory overhead.
  //  - Adding work should never result in an "explosion" where many
  //    more threads are created than the available cores.
  //  - Jobs should run on threads with an appropriate priority.
  //  - Thread priorities should temporarily elevatable to avoid
  //    priority inversions.
  //
  // Of these, the first two are the most important.  Many programs
  // do not rely on high-usage priority scheduling, and many priority
  // inversions can be avoided at a higher level (albeit with some
  // performance cost, e.g. by creating higher-priority tasks to run
  // critical sections that contend with high-priority work).  In
  // contrast, if the async feature adds too much overhead, or if
  // heavy use of it leads to thread explosions and memory exhaustion,
  // programmers will have no choice but to stop using it.  So if
  // goals are in conflict, it's best to focus on core properties over
  // priority-inversion avoidance.

  // We currently use Dispatch for our thread pool on all platforms.
  // Dispatch currently backs its serial queues with a global
  // concurrent queue that is prone to thread explosions when a flood
  // of jobs are added to it.  That problem does not apply equally

  // which are not strictly CPU-limited but are at least much more
