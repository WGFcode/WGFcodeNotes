// ==== Task Cancellation ------------------------------------------------------

/// Execute an operation with cancellation handler which will immediately be
/// invoked if the current task is cancelled.
///
/// This differs from the operation cooperatively checking for cancellation
/// and reacting to it in that the cancellation handler is _always_ and
/// _immediately_ invoked when the task is cancelled. For example, even if the
/// operation is running code which never checks for cancellation, a cancellation
/// handler still would run and give us a chance to run some cleanup code.
///
/// Does not check for cancellation, and always executes the passed `operation`.
///
/// This function returns instantly and will never suspend.
