/// Incrementally compute and represent basic block liveness of a single live
/// range. The live range is defined by points in the CFG, independent of any
/// particular SSA value. The client initializes liveness with a set of
/// definition blocks, typically a single block. The client then incrementally
/// updates liveness by providing a set of "interesting" uses one at a time.
///
/// This supports discovery of pruned liveness during control flow traversal. It
/// is not tied to a single SSA value and allows the client to select
/// interesting uses while ignoring other uses.
///
/// The PrunedLiveBlocks result maps each block to its current liveness state:
/// Dead, LiveWithin, LiveOut.
///
/// A LiveWithin block has a liveness boundary within the block. The client can
/// determine the boundary's intruction position by searching for the last use.
///
/// LiveOut indicates that liveness extends into a successor edges, therefore,
/// no uses within that block can be on the liveness boundary, unless that use
/// occurs before a def in the same block.
///
/// All blocks are initially assumed Dead. Initializing a definition block marks
/// that block LiveWithin. Each time an interesting use is discovered, blocks
/// liveness may undergo one of these transitions:
///
/// - Dead -> LiveWithin
/// - Dead -> LiveOut
/// - LiveWithin -> LiveOut
///
/// Example 1. Local liveness.
///
///  -----
/// |     | [Dead]
///  -----
///    |
///  -----
/// | Def | [LiveWithin]
/// | Use |
///  -----
///    |
///  -----
/// |     | [Dead]
///  -----
///
/// Example 2. Cross-block liveness.
///
/// Initial State:
///
///  -----
/// | Def | [LiveOut]

///    |
///  -----
/// |     | [Dead]
///  -----

/// definition in a def block. Since this analysis does not remember the
/// positions of defs, it assumes that, within a block, uses follow
/// defs. Breaking this assumption will result in a "hole" in the live range in
/// which the def block's predecessors incorrectly remain dead. This situation
